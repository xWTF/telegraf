# 4.12.0

Normally the most exciting features of a new release would be support for the latest Bot API. But in this update, it's session! This has been in the works for many months, and we're happy to bring it to you this release!

## Stable session

Some of you may know that builtin session has been deprecated for quite a while. This was motivated by the fact that session is prone to race-conditions ([#1372](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf/issues/1372)). This left the community in a grey area where they continued to use session despite the deprecation, since no clear alternative was provided. Added to this was the fact that there were no official database-backed sessions, and all unofficial async session middleware were affected by [#1372](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf/issues/1372).

This release finally addresses both of these long-running issues.

### No more race conditions

[#1713](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf/pull/1713) provides a reference-counted implementation resistant to race conditions. Session is now no longer deprecated, and can be used safely!

> Note: You should read more about how to safely use session in the [docs repo](https://github.com/feathers-studio/telegraf-docs/blob/b694bcc36b4f71fb1cd650a345c2009ab4d2a2a5/guide/session.md).

### Official database adapters are here!

We're also happy to announce a revamped [`@telegraf/session`](https://github.com/telegraf/session)—this provides official store implementations for database-backed sessions via Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. Just install the drivers necessary for your database, and off you go! Since this package now only provides a `store` implementation, it's usable with builtin session, and effectively makes all implementations have the same safety as the core package. [Check it out!](https://github.com/telegraf/session)

### Default session

Additionally, session now accepts a `defaultSession` parameter. You no longer need a hacky middleware to do `ctx.session ??= { count }`.

```TS
// 🤢 Old way
bot.use(session());
bot.use((ctx, next) => {
  ctx.session ??= { count: 0 };
  return next();
});

// 😁 New way ✅
bot.use(session({ defaultSession: () => ({ count: 0 }) }));
```

## Bot API 6.5 support

- Updated Typegram, added the following Markup.button helpers to request a user or chat:
- `Markup.button.userRequest`
- `Markup.button.botRequest`
- `Markup.button.groupRequest`
- `Markup.button.channelRequest`
- `Telegram::setChatPermissions` and `Context::setChatPermissions` accept a new parameter for `{ use_independent_chat_permissions?: boolean }` as documented in the [API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setchatpermissions).

## Bot API 6.4 support

- Updated Typegram, added the following new methods to class `Telegram` and `Context`:
- `editGeneralForumTopic`
- `closeGeneralForumTopic`
- `reopenGeneralForumTopic`
- `hideGeneralForumTopic`
- `unhideGeneralForumTopic`
- `Context::sendChatAction` will automatically infer `message_thread_id` for topic messages.
- Fix for `'this' Context of type 'NarrowedContext' is not assignable to method's 'this' of type 'Context<Update>'`.

## RegExp support for commands!

Another long-standing problem was the lack of support for RegExp or case-insensitive command matching. This is here now:

```TS
bot.command("hello", ctx => ctx.reply("You sent a case-sensitive /hello"));
bot.command(/^hello$/i, ctx => ctx.reply("You sent a case-insensitive /hELLo"));
```

## fmt helpers

- New `join` fmt helper to combine dynamic arrays into a single FmtString.

```TS
import { fmt, bold, join } from "telegraf/format";

// elsewhere
bot.command("/fruits", async ctx => {
  const array = ["Oranges", "Apples", "Grapes"];
  const fruitList = join(array.map(fruit => bold(fruit)), "\n");
  const msg = fmt`Fruits to buy:\n${fruitList}`;
  await ctx.sendMessage(msg);
});
```

- Fixed various bugs in fmt helpers, so things like `bold(italic("telegraf"))` will now work as expected.
